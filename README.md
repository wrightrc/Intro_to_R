# An introduction to R and RStudio 
This material was designed as a process-oriented guided-inquiry learning activity for an upper level biology course. 

You can download this material and have students work through it using either the docx, html, or Rmd file. You may also alter the Intro_to_R.Rmd file to fit your class and knit a new docx or html file.

One key point is to make sure your students have the paths to "flowTime_0.99.1.tgz", "flowSet", and "annotaion.csv" specified correctly. Also, it is helpful to test the package installation section on the computers the students will be using prior to class, as there are frequently warnings and or errors triggered in this section.
